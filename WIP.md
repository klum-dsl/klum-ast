Transient notes for current task:

- Lifecycle methods might be moved to RW class, since they usually change the model
- $manualValidation field should be moved to RW

- Create Methods could be bundled in a static Create class to further reduce
  signature clutter
  
- RW class should implement asType(<ModelClass>)
