This page contains some of the milestones for next versions

# 1.1
With the release of 1.0, the next important step is pruning of the API,
i.e. removing of deprecated methods from pre 1.0.

1.1 will also change the dependant groovy version to 2.4.

No new features will be implemented in 1.1, only bugfixes.

# 1.2
More features as found in the issues.
