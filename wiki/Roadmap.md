# 2.0 -> redesign

2.0 marks an extensive redesign, the switch to a more modular approach and the introduction of a runtime dependency. 
I tried to keep necessary migration steps to a minimum, but some changes are necessary, see [[Migration]] for Details.

Status: Mature, I some features that I would to include

# 2.1 -> Interface Stripdown

2.1 will be released almost immediately after 2.0, it will mostly be 2.0 with deprecated methods removed.

# 2.x -> New Features (unplanned)

I do not plan release additional features for 2.x

# 3.0 -> Drop Groovy 2 support

As with 2.1, this will be released soon after 2.0 (and 2.1) and will only consist of dropping Groovy 2 support.

# 3.x -> New Features (unplanned)
